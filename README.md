## Wanna know the latest twists of our dev saga? ##

<p>Now a mainframe developer for one of (according to Forbes) world's top 100 largest companies! First IT job and I got to touch a shiny IBM z15! 
Woof, that was a quick turn of events!

Unfortunately, we have a custom solution for version control, so you won't see me around as much :(

<p>Systems Analysis and Development (Associate â€“ 2022).  

Now picking up COBOL, Natural, JCL, z/OS and other mainframe goodies.

Still, feel free to contact if you have a cool open source project in need of an extra hand.
